# PrintReady - Print Stylesheet Toolkit for NZ Government Agencies

## Project Overview
PrintReady is an optional open source toolkit that simplifies the implementation of print-friendly web pages for New Zealand government agencies. It provides developers with ready-to-use CSS and JavaScript files that create professional, accessible printed documents while maintaining compliance with NZ Government Web Standards.

## Key Purpose
- Enable compliance with NZ Government Web Usability Standard 3.3 (Printable web pages)
- Reduce development effort for print stylesheet implementation
- Ensure consistency across government agency websites when printed
- Support the all-of-government (AoG) community through collaborative development

## Critical Constraints & Requirements

### NZ Government Web Standards Compliance
PrintReady must ensure compliance with these specific requirements:
- Main content must be printable on A4 paper
- Printed pages must include agency name or logo
- Must exclude: primary/secondary navigation, search forms, decorative elements
- Text should print as black on white background by default

### File Architecture Rules
- **Base files** (printready-base.css, printready-base.js): NEVER modify these core files
- **Site files** (printready-site.css, printready-site.js): ALWAYS customize these for your website
- CSS files must use media="print" attribute
- Screen stylesheets must use media="screen" attribute
- JavaScript files must use type="module"

## Development Philosophy

### Enhance, Don't Replace
PrintReady leverages browser default print stylesheets and enhances them only where necessary. We work with browser capabilities rather than against them.

### Separation of Concerns
Strict separation between print and screen styles using CSS media queries:
- Print styles only affect printed output
- Screen styles only affect on-screen display
- No interference between rendering contexts

### Modular Design
- Core functionality in base files enables consistent updates
- Site-specific customization in separate files preserves local modifications
- Print-only components use .print-only class (hidden on screen, visible in print)

## Implementation Patterns

### Essential Customizations Required
1. Replace BREADCRUMBS selector with your site's breadcrumb CSS selector
2. Replace IMAGES_TO_SHOW with selectors for images that should print
3. Replace INSERT_ELEMENTS_TO_HIDE with selectors for elements to hide when printing
4. Replace AGENCY_NAME with your organization's name
5. Set YOUR_RENDER_TARGET for where page links should appear

### Print Content Strategy
Follow this principle: "Only print elements that are essential for understanding the page's content or context"

Typically hide:
- Site navigation (primary and secondary)
- Headers and footers
- Interactive elements (buttons, form controls, accordion toggles)
- Decorative elements
- Search functionality

Typically show:
- Main content
- Agency name/logo
- Page title, date, and URL (via JavaScript functions)
- Essential images (explicitly selected)
- External link URLs as footnotes

### JavaScript Functions Available
- showAgency(agencyName): Displays agency name in print view
- showPageInformation(): Shows page title, print date, and URL
- initializePrintButton(selector): Makes print button functional
- generateListOfPageLinks(): Creates footnoted list of external links

## Live Demos
View live examples to see the difference PrintReady makes:
- With PrintReady: https://govtnz.github.io/print-ready/with-printready.html
- Without PrintReady: https://govtnz.github.io/print-ready/without-printready.html

Use browser print preview (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P) or DevTools print media emulation to compare the print formatting between the two examples.

## Common Integration Scenarios
- Government CMS platforms requiring print compliance
- Multi-agency websites needing consistent print formatting
- Public-facing government services requiring accessible printed output
- Content-heavy government sites with complex navigation structures

## Testing Approach
- Browser print preview (Ctrl+P / Cmd+P)
- Browser DevTools print media emulation
- Playwright tests for JavaScript functionality (included in repo)
- Cross-browser compatibility testing for print rendering

## Community & Support
- All communication through GitHub repository channels only
- Issues for bugs and concrete feature requests
- Discussions for implementation questions and community sharing
- Pull requests welcome from AoG community and broader open source community
- No email support provided

## Version Strategy
Project follows semantic versioning with clear changelog documentation for government users who need stable, predictable updates.
