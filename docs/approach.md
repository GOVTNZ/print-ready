# Approach 
PrintReady leverages the browserâ€™s default stylesheet, which is already effective for printed content, and enhances it only where necessary for example, by managing page layouts to prevent awkward breaks and maintain professional formatting.

It embraces the principle of separation of concerns by applying the print styles exclusively for printing while keeping the screen styles only for screen rendering.

It is designed to be flexible, separating core styles from site-specific needs and allowing easy customisation across different websites.
