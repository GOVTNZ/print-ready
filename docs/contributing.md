# Contributing to PrintReady 

PrintReady welcomes contributions from across the all-of-government community. Whether you're fixing bugs, improving documentation, adding new features, or sharing implementation experiences, your contributions help make government web services more accessible and user-friendly for all New Zealanders.

All project communication happens exclusively through standard GitHub channels:

* **Issues** for bug reports, feature requests and suggested documentation changes
* **Pull Requests** for code contributions and documentation improvements
* **Discussions** for feedback, brainstorming and general questions 

We do not provide email support or alternative contact methods - please use the GitHub repository for all project-related communication.
